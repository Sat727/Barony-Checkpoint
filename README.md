Work in progress "Checkpoint System" for Barony, it's more of a save scum version of the game, where the saves dont delete themselves once all players die. I created a solo verion of the mod here in python: https://github.com/Sat727/Barony-Checkpoint-System.


# What it does

The modifications to the EXE for now only disables the packet sent to players connected to the server to delete the savefile/game over, and prevents the client itself from deleting the savefile resulting in no progress loss once all players die.
